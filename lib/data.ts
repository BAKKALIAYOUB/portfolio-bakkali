    description: "Developing a comprehensive data processing pipeline utilizing Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time analysis and prediction. By leveraging Apache Kafka, I efficiently streamed data to Apache Spark for immediate classification. Within Spark, I implemented a predictive model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the incoming data streams and generate real-time insights. Additionally, I designed and integrated a user-friendly dashboard interface for monitoring predictions in real time, providing users with valuable insights into trends and patterns. The project involved the use of technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker, MongoDB, Zookeeper, and a machine learning pipeline.",

This system combines retrieval, reading, and generation capabilities to offer accurate responses. The chatbot features a user-friendly interface where users can input their questions and receive answers generated based on the retrieved context from a vector database. This project leveraged advanced technologies including Langchain, Large Language Models (LLMs), chromadb, Docker, Next.js, RAG, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Ollama.",

By integrating Ethereum smart contracts with IPFS for decentralized storage, the system ensures the immutability of records while allowing secure sharing of data among authorized healthcare professionals. Developed using Next.js for the frontend and Ethers.js for Ethereum interaction, the application provides a user-friendly interface for managing patient information. The system also employs encryption and decentralized authentication to guarantee the highest level of security, offering a transparent and tamper-proof solution to traditional healthcare data management systems.",
